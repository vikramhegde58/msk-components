### Contribution steps

If you are a student or an entry level developer and want to get started with the contribution, you will need to learn few concepts first before starting your contribution to this project.

If you are already an experience developer, you can directly goto **Step 5**.

##### Let's get started.

- Read basics of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- Read basics of [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.3.0)
- A brief introduction to [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Commonly used [npm commands](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm)

**One you are comfortable with the above basic concepts, you need to learn to use the below tools**

- Basics of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) ( forking, cloning, commiting and raising pull requests )
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and get familiar with the code editor

Now you are ready to start coding.

##### Step 1 : Fork this repository.

Once you fork, git will create a copy of msk-components to your personal github space.

##### Step 2 : Clone your forked repo into your local machine

Once you clone, you will have the project in your computer. Go ahead and open the project in VS Code.

##### Step 3 : Install Node

Node is required to run this project as this is a react app.

##### Step 4 : Run the project

run `npm install` in the project root directory. This will install all the node_modules required. 

run `npm start`. This will open the application on http://localhost:6501/


##### Step 5 : Create a branch and start coding

There is a folder called **[sample](https://github.com/ManojSatishkumar/msk-components/tree/master/src/modules/resume/sample)** inside the **[resume](https://github.com/ManojSatishkumar/msk-components/tree/master/src/modules/resume)** module. Go ahead and check all the files inside. There is a detailed documentation at the beginning of each file. This should give you enough explanation about the file and certain rules and best practices to be followed.

Once you are familiar with the sample component, go ahead and add your own components and variants.

##### Step 6 : Sumbit your pull request

After finishing your code, you are ready to contribute. Go ahead and make a commit and push the changes to your fork branch. Then submit a pull request to msk-components/master.

##### Step 7 : Get your code reviewed

Assign few contributors as reviewers and get your code reviewed. You will need approvals from 3 other contributors for your pull request to get merged.
